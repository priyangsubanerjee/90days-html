# Motivating Button

Alas! you have started buiilding your first `web` project and we are aiming to a simple webpage that alerts the audience with some motivational quotes on some click events.

## Getting started

- Create a folder with a name of your choice
- Open it using your favourite IDE
- Inside the same folder create 3 more files `index.html` `style.css` `script.js`

- `index.html` will contain the skeleton structure of your webpage which includes the necessary html components such as buttons, paragraphs, headings, alerts

- `style.css` refers to the cascading style sheet which will indeed stye the skeleton of your project

- `script.js` will contain all the javascript code necessary, from listening for an event to show an output after necessary computations.

### Output

- User visits the page on his browser
- Click the button
- Alert appears with some random quotes

### Things you should focus on

- Inside `index.html`

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

What does viewport refers to? Why do we need to set a initial scale?

```
 <script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

Whats the use of defer attribute? What errors do you get on removing it.

- Inside `style.css`

Html elements can be queries using various paramenters, most widely used are the `id` & `class`. While referring in the css file `#` is used when referred using id & `.` is used when referred by class.

- Understand the `script.js` thorougly theres where the magic happens :)
