# Motivating Button

Alas! you have started buiilding your first `web` project and we are aiming to a simple webpage that alerts the audience with some motivational quotes on some click events.

## Getting started

- Create a folder with a name of your choice
- Open it using your favourite IDE
- Inside the same folder create 3 more files `index.html` `style.css` `script.js`

- `index.html` will contain the skeleton structure of your webpage which includes the necessary html components such as buttons, paragraphs, headings, alerts

- `style.css` refers to the cascading style sheet which will indeed stye the skeleton of your project

- `script.js` will contain all the javascript code necessary, from listening for an event to show an output after necessary computations.
